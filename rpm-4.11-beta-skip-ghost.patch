    Be more careful about skipping shared file/directory creation
    
    - Only skip shared file/dir creation if its actually being created
      by another package. Previously we could've decided to skip an entry
      where the other file was also being skipped for some other reason.
    - Ensure %ghost entries always have FA_SKIP on install, previously
      they often were FA_CREATE which makes no sense for %ghost. We dont
      encounter %ghosts at all during install in the FSM as they dont
      exist in the payload, but the file disposition calculations need
      to take them into account now that we're avoiding redundant creates.
    - Fixes a regression from commit f7f5f88f9f3d6587e747b034ccb64a3f00ff4e1e
      which unearthed the %ghost FA_CREATE issue, reported here:
